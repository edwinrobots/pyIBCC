--- Steps to run the tutorial examples from a command line ---

1. Go to the root directory of this package:

cd /path/to/pyIBCC 

2. Add the code to the Python path:

export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:./python

3. Run the population density example:

python python/tutorial/popdensity_simple.py

This scipt does the follwing:
 - Loads some real crowdsourcing data for a satellite image labelling project from "./data/crowd_matrix_nepal_2015.csv". This task involved volunteers classifying images into 6 categories, depending on the density of housing shown in the images.
 - Lines 26 and 28 combine the data using IBCC-VB algorithm
 - Lines 23 to 24 set the prior hyperparameters, alpha0, for the confusion matrices.  
 - The results are saved to the files './output/popdensity_pyibcc_probabilities.csv'
and './output/popdensity_pyibcc_predicted_labels.csv'. 
 - The code then prints the expected confusion matrix for a chosen worker and plots the posterior distribution for that worker's accuracy (diagonal elements of the confusion matrix) for each of the true class labels. You can change which worker you view by setting the index in line 38

4. Compile and run the argument annotation example in the same way as step 3, but change the file names from "popdensity_simple.py" to "argument_annotation_simple.py".
